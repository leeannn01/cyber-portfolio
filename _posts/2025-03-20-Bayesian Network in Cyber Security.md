# Introduction: Why Bayesian Networks for Cybersecurity?

Modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often machine learning-based and require massive labeled datasets to detect threats. However, cybersecurity is highly dynamic, and zero-day attacks make traditional ML models ineffective.

So how do we detect threats without labeled training data?  
The answer lies in **Bayesian Networks (BNs)**—a probabilistic approach that models uncertainty and learns dynamically.

In this deep dive, we’ll cover:
✔️ Mathematical Foundations of Bayesian Networks  
✔️ Why BNs outperform ML-based methods for anomaly detection  
✔️ How to implement Bayesian AI for cybersecurity  
✔️ Benchmarking Bayesian AI vs. Traditional ML  


# The Problem with Traditional ML-Based IDS

Most cybersecurity AI models are supervised and trained on datasets like:
- **CICIDS2018** (Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity Intrusion Dataset)
- **UNSW-NB15** (University of New South Wales Intrusion Dataset)
- **DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data**

###  Problems with Supervised ML-Based IDS:
1. **Requires Labeled Data**: Needs thousands of attack and normal traffic samples.
2. **Fails on Zero-Day Attacks**: Cannot detect new threats not seen in training.
3. **High False Positives**: Struggles with adaptive adversaries and noisy traffic.
4. **Retraining Overhead**: Needs continuous retraining to stay effective.

# Bayesian Networks: The Future of AI in Cybersecurity

Unlike traditional ML models, **Bayesian Networks (BNs)** use probabilistic inference to classify and detect anomalies.

### What is a Bayesian Network?

A **Bayesian Network** is a graphical model representing conditional dependencies between variables.

### Mathematically, a BN consists of:
- **Nodes (N):** Representing events (e.g., "Malicious Traffic", "Port Scan").
- **Edges (E):** Conditional dependencies between events.
- **Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs):** Probability distributions of each node given its parents.

### Example: Bayesian Network for Network Intrusion
- **Event:** "Unusual Packet Size" → "High Risk Anomaly" (depends on conditional probability)
- **Event:** "Source IP in Threat Intelligence Feed" → "Potential Malicious Activity"
- **Event:** "Port Scan Detected" → "Risk of Exploit"

This graphical representation allows probabilistic reasoning to determine if a traffic event is an attack.

# Mathematical Foundation: Bayesian Inference for Anomaly Detection

Bayesian AI uses **Bayes’ Theorem** to update probabilities dynamically:

```markdown
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- **P(A|B)** = Probability of Attack A given Evidence B  
- **P(B|A)** = Probability of Evidence B occurring in an Attack A  
- **P(A)** = Prior probability of an attack occurring  
- **P(B)** = Probability of observing Evidence B  

### Example: Detecting Malicious Traffic
If:
- \( P(\text{Anomaly}) = 0.02 \) (2%)
- \( P(\text{High Packet Size} | \text{Anomaly}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(\text{High Packet Size}) = 0.10 \) (10%)

Then:

\[
P(\text{Anomaly} | \text{High Packet Size}) = \frac{0.85 \times 0.02}{0.10} = 0.17
\]

**Key Takeaway**: If a packet has unusually high packet size, there is a **17% probability** that it is part of anomalous/malicious traffic.
