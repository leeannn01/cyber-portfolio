# Introduction: Rethinking AI in Cybersecurity

Traditional AI models rely heavily on **labeled datasets** to detect cyber threats. But in cybersecurity, attackers constantly evolve, creating **zero-day threats** that **data-driven model**s may fail to detect.

So, can we train AI without training data?

The answer lies in Prior-Knowledge-Informed AI, a hybrid approach that blends expert security rules, probabilistic inference (Bayesian), and adaptive learning to detect threats without massive datasets.

# Problems with Traditional ML Models

## Challenge 1: **Supervised Learning Needs Labels**
Models like Random Forests and Neural Networks require large, labeled datasets like CICIDS2018 & UNSW-NB15.

**Problem**: Collecting labeled cybersecurity data is expensive, time-consuming, and incomplete.

#### Real-world example of failure:
In 2019, a Microsoft Defender AI model failed because attackers poisoned training dataâ€”uploading harmless files disguised as malware, tricking the AI into false detections.

## Challenge 2: **Zero-Day Attacks Go Unnoticed**
Since ML models generalize from past data, they fail to detect new attack patterns.

**Problem**: Zero-day attacks (never-before-seen threats) do not exist in historical datasets.

#### Real-world example of failure:
In 2020, adversaries bypassed VirusTotalâ€™s AI-based malware detection by slightly modifying malware binaries, making them undetectable by pre-trained models.

## Challenge 3: **Retraining Overhead**:
Data-driven models need *constant retraining*, which is computationally expensive and impractical for real-time security.

**Problem**: This process is computationally expensive and impractical for real-time security.

#### Key Takeaway: Traditional ML models are reactive, not proactive. Cybersecurity needs a more adaptive AI approach.

# A Different Approach: Prior-Knowledge-Informed AI

Instead of relying on past attack data, we can combine expert cybersecurity knowledge with **AI-driven probabilistic inference**.

#### **Key Idea**: Use of *Predefined rules* + *adaptive learning* to detect threat

### How it works?
- **Rule-Based Heuristics**: Detect known attacks (e.g., SYN floods, unusual port scans).
- **Bayesian Networks**: Compute the probability of an anomaly based on packet size & network behavior.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjust thresholds dynamically as network traffic evolves.

# The Hybrid AI Model: Implementing Prior-Knowledge AI

Instead of a black-box machine learning model, we implement a transparent hybrid model combining:
- Rule-based heuristics (for immediate threat recognition)
- Bayesian probability models (for anomaly scoring)
- Adaptive learning mechanisms (to refine detection accuracy over time)

## Implementation Steps

1. Data Collection â€“ Capture live network traffic using tcpdump or Wireshark.
2. Feature Extraction â€“ Extract packet size, source IP, destination IP, protocol, entropy.
3. Rule-Based Detection â€“ Use heuristics to detect known threats instantly.
4. Bayesian Anomaly Detection â€“ Compute probability scores for unknown threats.
5. Adaptive Learning â€“ Dynamically refine anomaly thresholds to reduce false positives.

# Benchmark : Hybrid AI vs. Traditional ML-Based IDS

To validate the effectiveness of Prior-Knowledge AI, letâ€™s compare it with standard ML-based IDS models.

| Method                                          | Zero-Day Attack Detection? | False Positives | Adaptability                |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Random Forest (ML)                             |  No                     |  High        |  Requires retraining      |
| LSTM (Deep Learning)                           |  No                     |  High        |  Requires labeled dataset |
| Bayesian Prior-Knowledge AI (Hybrid Model)     |  Yes                    |  Low         |  Learns dynamically       |


# Conclusion: The Future is Hybrid AI

Traditional ML models are no longer enough for modern cybersecurity threats.
A Prior-Knowledge-Informed AI system provides:
- Real-time, zero-day threat detection without labeled datasets.
- Adaptive learning to refine detection accuracy.
- Explainability & confidence scoring for security analysts.
