# Introduction

The objective of this project was to develop a PCAP (Packet Capture) Analysis Tool that efficiently processes network traffic data, extracts valuable insights, and identifies protocols, MAC address vendors, payloads, and downloadable files. The project evolved through multiple iterations, addressing various challenges and refining the approach to achieve high accuracy and efficiency.
This report provides an overview of the thought process, challenges faced, decisions made, setup requirements, and implementation details of the final PCAP analysis tool.
