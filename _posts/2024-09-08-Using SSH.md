# Secure Shell (SSH)

**What is SSH and its usage?**
- SSH (Secure Shell) is a crytographic network protocol that allows secure communication between two systems, typically a client and a server. over an unsecured network.

- Usage:
    - Remote login
    - File transfer
    - Command execution on remote machine


**Using SSH to log into a host on a specific port**
`ssh username@hostname -p port_number`
- **`username`**: The username you want to log in as.
- **`hostname`**: The remote hostâ€™s IP address or domain name.
- **`-p port_number`**: Specifies the port number if the SSH service is running on a non-default port (the default SSH port is `22`).


# Alternatives for Non-SSH connectionns
- if you are trying to connect to a service running on a specific port using a different protocol (e.g. telnet), you can use the telnet command

**Using Telnet**
`telnet hostname portnumber`
E.g. `telnet example.com 8080`
    - This command connects to example.com on port 8080 using the telent protocol. However telnet is typically used for testing network services rather than secure login since it is not encrypted

**Using Netcat (NC)**
- You can also use nc (Netcat) to connect to a specific host and port for testing
    - `nc hostname port_number`
