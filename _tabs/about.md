## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm a passionate and independent learner in the field of cybersecurity, driven by curiosity and the thrill of solving complex puzzles. To me, cybersecurity is like a multi-dimensional mysteryâ€”every threat detected and neutralized is another puzzle solved.

My journey began with a strong interest in network fundamentals, diving deep into the OSI Model and understanding how data travels through various layers, each vulnerable to unique types of cyber threats. This foundational knowledge fuels my continuous exploration of network analysis, leveraging powerful tools like Wireshark and techniques such as packet analysis to uncover insights hidden in plain sight.

With each new challenge, my enthusiasm growsâ€”because in cybersecurity, learning never stops, and every day presents a new puzzle waiting to be solved.
